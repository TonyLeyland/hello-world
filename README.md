# hello-world
Just my first Repo as a test

- This is a new line for the new Branch
- This line is going to be merged with the TonyLeyland Repo
- New line added in the original Repo
- Line added by Fork
- Another line added in the original Repo
- This new line brings it ahead of the Fork that was made

This fork differs from baseflight in that it attempts to use modern software development practices which result in:

1. Greater reliability through code robustness and automated testing. 
2. Easier maintenance through code cleanliness.
3. Easier to develop new features. 

The MultiWii software, from which baseflight originated, violates many good software development best-practices.

- HAVE WHITE SPACE
- MAKE IT PRETTY
- GIFS ARE REALLY COOL

## Additional Features

Cleanflight also has additional features not found in baseflight.

* Oneshot ESC support.
* Blackbox flight recorder logging (to onboard flash or external SD card).
* Support for additional targets that use the STM32F3 processors.
